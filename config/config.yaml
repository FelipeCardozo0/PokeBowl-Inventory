# Poke Bowl Inventory System Configuration
# Production configuration for Jetson Orin Nano deployment

# USB Camera Settings
camera:
  # V4L2 device index (0 = /dev/video0, 1 = /dev/video1, etc.)
  index: 0
  
  # Resolution (adjust based on your camera's native resolution)
  width: 1280
  height: 720
  
  # Target frames per second
  fps: 30

# YOLO Detector Settings
detector:
  # Path to trained model (relative to project root or absolute path)
  model_path: best.pt
  
  # Confidence threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
  # Lower = more detections (more false positives)
  # Higher = fewer detections (more false negatives)
  conf_threshold: 0.25
  
  # IoU threshold for Non-Maximum Suppression (0.0 to 1.0)
  # Lower = more aggressive filtering of overlapping boxes
  # Higher = allows more overlapping detections
  iou_threshold: 0.45
  
  # Input image size for YOLO (should match training)
  # Common values: 320, 416, 640, 1280
  imgsz: 640
  
  # CUDA device ('0' for GPU, 'cpu' for CPU)
  # On Jetson, use '0' for GPU acceleration
  device: '0'
  
  # Enable FP16 half precision (recommended for Jetson)
  # Reduces memory usage and increases speed with minimal accuracy loss
  half: true

# Inventory Tracking Settings
inventory:
  # Number of frames to use for temporal smoothing
  # Higher = more stable counts but slower response to changes
  # Lower = faster response but more noise
  smoothing_window: 10
  
  # Smoothing method: 'median', 'mean', or 'mode'
  # - median: Best for removing outliers (recommended)
  # - mean: Smooth averaging
  # - mode: Most common value
  smoothing_method: median

# Web Server Settings
server:
  # Host address
  # '0.0.0.0' = accessible from all network interfaces
  # '127.0.0.1' = localhost only
  host: '0.0.0.0'
  
  # Port number
  port: 8080

# Video Streaming Settings
stream:
  # Target FPS for video stream
  # Lower = reduced CPU/GPU usage and bandwidth
  # Higher = smoother video but more resource intensive
  target_fps: 30
