## Post-Deployment Validation

### Functional Tests

#### Camera Test
- [ ] Live video feed displays
- [ ] Frame rate acceptable (15+ FPS)
- [ ] No significant lag or stuttering
- [ ] Camera reconnects if unplugged and replugged

#### Detection Test
- [ ] Objects detected correctly
- [ ] Bounding boxes drawn accurately
- [ ] Class labels correct
- [ ] Confidence scores reasonable (>0.25)

#### Inventory Test
- [ ] Counts update in real-time
- [ ] Counts stable (not flickering)
- [ ] Multiple items counted correctly
- [ ] Counts reset when items removed

#### Web Interface Test
- [ ] Accessible from Jetson (localhost:8080)
- [ ] Accessible from LAN (jetson-ip:8080)
- [ ] Multiple clients can connect simultaneously
- [ ] Reconnects automatically after network interruption

#### Stability Test
- [ ] System runs for 1 hour without issues
- [ ] No memory leaks observed
- [ ] CPU/GPU usage stable
- [ ] No service crashes

### Performance Validation

Check performance metrics:
```bash
# GPU stats
tegrastats

# Service status
sudo systemctl status pokebowl-inventory

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u pokebowl-inventory -n 50
```

- [ ] FPS: 15-30 (acceptable range)
- [ ] Inference time: 30-50ms
- [ ] CPU usage: <60%
- [ ] GPU usage: <50%
- [ ] Memory usage: <500MB
- [ ] No error logs

### Network Test

- [ ] Port 8080 open and responding
- [ ] WebSocket connection stable
- [ ] Multiple devices can connect

---

## Optimization (Optional)

### Performance Tuning

If experiencing low FPS:
- [ ] Enable max performance mode:
  ```bash
  sudo nvpmodel -m 0
  sudo jetson_clocks
  ```
- [ ] Reduce camera resolution in `config.yaml`
- [ ] Lower YOLO input size to 416
- [ ] Reduce target FPS to 15

If experiencing high resource usage:
- [ ] Enable half precision in config
- [ ] Lower camera resolution
- [ ] Reduce smoothing window

### Kiosk Mode Optimization

If using HDMI display:
- [ ] Screen doesn't go to sleep
- [ ] Mouse cursor hidden in kiosk mode
- [ ] Browser automatically refreshes if needed
- [ ] Fullscreen mode working

---

## Monitoring Setup

### Enable Continuous Monitoring

Create monitoring script:
```bash
cat > ~/monitor_inventory.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
    echo "=== $(date) ==="
    systemctl status pokebowl-inventory --no-pager | head -5
    echo ""
    curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq
    echo ""
    sleep 60
done
EOF

chmod +x ~/monitor_inventory.sh
```

- [ ] Monitoring script created
- [ ] Can view system health

### Log Rotation

Ensure logs don't fill disk:
```bash
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
```

- [ ] Log rotation configured
- [ ] Disk space sufficient (>5GB free)

---

## Security Hardening (Production)

### Basic Security
- [ ] Change default SSH password
- [ ] Enable firewall:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw enable
  sudo ufw allow 22    # SSH
  sudo ufw allow 8080  # Web interface
  ```
- [ ] Disable unused services
- [ ] Keep system updated

### Network Security
- [ ] Restrict web interface to localhost if not needed externally:
  Edit `config.yaml`: `host: '127.0.0.1'`
- [ ] Consider VPN access instead of direct exposure
- [ ] Use strong WiFi password if using wireless

### Advanced Security (Optional)
- [ ] Implement authentication on web interface
- [ ] Use HTTPS with SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up fail2ban for SSH protection
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled

---

## Backup Configuration

### Create Backup
```bash
cd ~/Poke-Bowl---updated-January
tar -czf ~/pokebowl_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
    config/ best.pt deployment/ backend/ frontend/
```

- [ ] Configuration backed up
- [ ] Model file backed up
- [ ] Backup stored safely

### Recovery Plan
- [ ] Backup location documented
- [ ] Restore procedure tested
- [ ] Emergency contact information available
